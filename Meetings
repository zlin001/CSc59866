Group met with Ammar's project mentor

We all got the outline of the News to stocket market behavior project, basically to use past news headline and the stocket market 
behavior of the same period to predict hehavior of future stocket market. 

Approaches:
-Two data sources needed: 
1) set of headlines in the past
2) set of stockprices in the past

-Filters using NLP semantic analysis tools for headlines and stock prices 

-Filtered headlines and stockprices need to go through ML training to reach the prediction output we need.  ML training involving:
  -Bayesian classifier 
  -Logistic Regression
  -SVM
  -Neural networks
  
At the end of the discussion, we were told to have two member collects headlines and stock prices and structure them 
, and two members work on the ML training.
