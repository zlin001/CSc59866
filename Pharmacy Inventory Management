I have been working in a retail pharmacy for 7 years, and stock maintenance has always being an issue for pharmacy owner.  
I wish to design and build a software that allow stock maintenance, medication brand access, 
documentation and maybe more other features for purchasing and billing purposes.  
On top of that, we may set different priorities for store manager, pharmacist, technician, 
and cashier so they only get to access the part of data that is assigned to them.  
If possible, we may also add a portable device that can be carried around while checking the stock status. 




Professor and classmates, please leave your questions, comments, advice and concerns below this line if you have any. Thanks!
